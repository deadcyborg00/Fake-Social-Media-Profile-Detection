## üìñ Project Overview

Social media platforms are plagued by fake profiles‚Äîbots or malicious users that impersonate real accounts to spread misinformation, execute scams, and erode trust.  
This repository implements an AI‚Äëpowered detection framework combining:

- **Structured features** (e.g. follower/following ratios, post frequency, engagement metrics)  
- **Unstructured text analysis** (profile bios & post captions via NLP)  
- **Deep learning & synthetic data** (GAN‚Äëgenerated fake profiles)  
- **Dimensionality reduction** (PCA, LDA/MDA)  

The result is a scalable, adaptable system that flags suspicious accounts with high accuracy, recall, and precision.
